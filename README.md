# Skipper's Dotfiles

Various Config Files

## Philosophy

I tried to match the [XDG Base Directory Standards](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory) defaults as closely as possible. You should be able to copy this repo directly into your home directory.

## Installation

Any scriptable installation is handled by my [boostrapping repo](https://github.com/onesmallskipforman/bootstrap), which loads these dotfiles.
